# Scripts
Everything here runs from the command line.  They are a miscellany of utilities that I wrote to solve a particular problem.

## Python 
There are a couple short Python scripts here that take in baseball statistics.

## BASH
There are some SED and TR type things here.

## Beyond Compare
These end in .bc extension.  They are for the program Beyond Compare from www.scootersoftware.com ($30).  This program if you don't know it is a real Swiss Army Knife in the terminal.  
There are no free tools that go even half as far.  My only complaint is that its command line interface is secondary to its GUI development.

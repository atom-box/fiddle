This repository has a few dozen unrelated files. They are utilities I wrote and coding challenges I solved for practice.  

## Python 
A few Python scripts here take in baseball statistics.  
A few others are coding challenge solutions.  File extension is __.py__  

## BASH
These are mostly SED and TR pipelines.  File extension is __.sh__  

## Beyond Compare
Beyond Compare is a visual diff tool.  It also is a file sync tool.  These scripts are proprietary instructions for the latter.  File extension is __.bc__
